<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

<p>In the past year, the rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs) have erupted, and everyone in education seems to have taken notice. The largest provider of these MOOCs, Coursera, has amassed over 70 partners, including some of the foremost names in higher education &mdash; Stanford, Princeton, and Yale. Coursera offers over 330 courses and have garnered over 3.6 million registered users in just over a year. Similar providers such as edX and Udacity have also gained significant traction within the past year.</p>

<p>Supporters argue that MOOCs make education more widely available to underprivileged students around the world, while increasing the time instructors have for problem solving and guided discussions in the traditional classroom. Advocates of MOOCs claim that MOOCs are the solution to providing low cost, high availability and high quality education to the masses.</p>

<p>Detractors however, question the long term effects of this online revolution. Faculty at San Jose State University, an early pioneer in adopting a blended classroom model where MOOC content is mixed with classroom interaction, have expressed concern that online courses will adversely affect academics in public universities who face the dual threats of budget cuts and cost undercutting from MOOC providers.</p>

<p>Others worry about the potentially homogenizing effects of MOOCs and the suppression of intellectual freedom or about the quality of MOOC instruction and its effects on students in institutions who adopt blended classroom models. Criticism has also been levelled at MOOCs for what is perceived to be low retention and completion rates as well as for the skewed demographic of its audience.</p>

<p>In this project, we seek to examine the impact of these MOOCs with regards to (a) the impact of MOOCs on the traditional forms of higher education and (b) the efficacy of MOOCs and blended learning approaches.</p>
