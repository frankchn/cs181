<h3>State of Higher Education</h3>
<p>A degree has always been considered the key to a stable, well-paying job in America. However, in recent years, problems such as ever-increasing tuition costs, ballooning student debt, long waiting lists for classes and shrinking educational and financial returns have dogged the higher education industry.</p>
<h4>Rising Costs, Rising Debts</h4>
<img src="images/college_inflation.png" border="0" style="float:right;margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:15px;width:350px">
<p>Between 1978 and 2012, the costs of tuition in the United States has risen by 1120% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- almost five times the inflation rate and more than the oft talked about rise in medical costs. Consequently, the cost of university education has risen from 23% of annual income in 2001 to about 38% in 2010 [1].</p>

<p>This rise in costs have the unfortunate result of pushing graduates deeper and deeper into debt in order to finance their educations. The college class of 2011 saw debt rise to $26,000 per college graduate, and the total amount of outstanding student debt has hit $1 trillion in the United States alone [2]. Two thirds of college students have to take out some form of loans, in addition to government Pell grants, in order to finance their education [2].</p>

<h4>Lack of Resources</h4>
<p>Coinciding with the rising costs and mounting debt, state university systems are resource starved as well. In California, California State University and community college students finding it hard to graduate as many of the courses required for graduation -- such as calculus -- are impacted in the CSU system and thus have restricted enrollments [3]. This has the unfortunate effect of lengthening graduation and consequently driving total college costs higher as tuition for more semesters have to be paid.</p>

<h4>Low Value</h4>
<p>The rising student debt would not be a problem if the universities provided programs for students that are actually worth the money they paid. However, this is not the case among a large swath of universities and majors in the United States. </p>
<p>At first glance, the salary gap between high school graduates and college graduates might seem substantial, but on closer examination, the gap is almost entirely due to the plummeting value of the high school diploma rather than any rise in value of the college degree [4]. In fact, after adjusting for inflation, college graduates starting in the job market today earns no more than a college graduate in 1975.</p>
<p>Although the fact that a university education will probably pay for itself and more overtime the lifetime of a graduate is still broadly true, there are several important caveats to consider. First, some college students who spent the money and took on debt may not graduate at all. Second, some degrees -- such as law -- have supply substantially beyond demand, leading to thousands of lawyers unable to find jobs [5]. The premise that the only way to deliver higher education is through the traditional university model is also increasing questioned.</p>
<p>Finally, it does not seem that these high costs incurred in education actually produces results. A federal survey demonstrated that only a quarter of students were deemed proficient in &quot;using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals and to develop one's knowledge and potential.&quot; [6]</p>
