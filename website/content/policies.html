<h3>Policies of MOOCs</h3>
<p>A major policy concern about the disruptive effect of MOOCs is their impact on academic freedom and integrity of faculty at state and community colleges.</p>
<p>This concern is illustrated by several recent events including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Debate over a proposed bill by the state of California legislature to mandate all state schools to give credit for accredited online courses replacing oversubscribed gateway courses.</li>
    <li>An open letter from the San Jose State University (SJSU) department of philosophy in reaction to an attempt by SJSU administration to force its dean of Humanities and Arts to adopt EdX’s JusticeX course (a course taught by Harvard professor Michael Sandel).</li>
    <li>Discussions between faculty and administration from the Georgia Institute of Technology regarding the proposed masters degree program offered in partnership between Udacity and Georgia Tech.</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue at the heart of these incidents is a perceived marginalization of faculty at so-called lower tier institutions and a growing concentration of influence into the hands of a small cabal of &quot;superstar&quot; professors, typically from prestigious institutions such as Stanford or Harvard.</p>
<p>In a revealing quote regarding the use of Professor Sandel’s JusticeX course, Prof. Brown, an associate professor of philosophy at SJSU, expressed fears that &quot;eventually, you will only have facilitators for those courses. There will be no need for professors or even graduate students&quot;.</p>
<p>Sandwiched between the prospect of budget cuts and the possibility of being undercut by low-cost MOOC offerings, faculty at many state and community colleges are understandably worried at what seems to be the dawn of an age in which the pedagogical role of faculty at state and community colleges will to serve as &quot;facilitators&quot; of cookie-cutter courses exported from their 
more prestigious brethren.</p>
<p>Instructors at state and community colleges are also raised regarding whether such content, transplanted from institutions with vastly different student demographics, will be relevant and pedagogically useful for their own student demographic.</p>
<p>Similar concerns are at play in the furor over a proposed piece of legislature in the California legislature which would compel state universities to accept for credit accredited online equivalents for gateway courses which are oversubscribed at these institutions. This legislation is aimed at reducing the large number (nearly half a million) of students who are unable to graduate due to being on wait-lists for required courses at state and community colleges.</p>
<p>While the intent behind such legislation is benign, colleges fear the loss of control over accreditation and discretion over which courses to accept for credit in their degree bearing programs.</p>
<p>In the end such concerns can only be alleviated once it becomes clearer which models of adopting MOOC content into on-campus education perform best. While the use of MOOC content in on-campus courses is only in its infancy, there already exist several viable alternatives:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use of MOOC materials directly with staff performing a supervisory or facilitative role such as the EdX-SJSU collaboration described above.</li>
    <li>Adaptation of MOOC materials as learning resources with faculty customizing content to suit the local context and using class time for interaction rather than lecturing (the flipped classroom model) such as (some of) partnerships between Coursera and their state systems partners.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with colleges to develop their own MOOC content for online degree granting programs such as the Udacity-Georgia Tech model.</li>
</ol>
<p>It remains to be seen if such worries about the erosion of faculty control over course content and accreditation are justified. However, an apt analogy may be to compare MOOC resources to textbooks.</p>
<p>Under several of the currently proposed schemes, MOOC providers envision that MOOC content will serve as a reference scaffolding for instructors at such institutions to develop their own courses. Just as there are typically multiple competing textbooks for the same content area, there may also be multiple competing MOOCs which instructors can choose from to construct their course.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just as instructors may choose to compile their own course readers or write their own textbooks if they feel that current resources are overly restrictive or if they wish to approach the subject from a novel perspective, MOOC providers are current in partnership with state and community schools to develop their own MOOC content targeted specifically at their student demographic.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is clear that policy decisions at the college, state or even federal level should consider clearly the impact of reducing the academic integrity of faculty at lower-tier institutions. While there do exist productive means of collaboration and integration with MOOC providers, care must be taken to avoid encroaching on the academic freedom necessary for healthy academic discourse to flourish.</p>

<h4>Concerns about reduced availability of research and teaching positions</h4>
<p>Another concern raised regarding the use of MOOC style content in on-campus instruction is a fear that the low cost of adapting MOOC content will mean that it will only make economic sense for large top tier institutions to retain significant staff or faculty.</p>
<p>While this outcome seems inevitable given that MOOC providers aim to reduce the escalating cost of higher education by increasingly automating tasks such as lecturing or grading, there may not be a dramatic reduction of availability of teaching positions for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current educational resources are under-provisioned. For example, even with the aid of MOOC style or flipped classroom instruction, it is debatable whether the large number of students currently on waitlists at California’s state schools can be accommodated.</li>
    <li>On-campus education consists of more than simply taking courses. Easing the burden of instructors to perform menial tasks such as grading or delivering lectures will allow them to focus on tasks which add value to students in ways which online education cannot deliver.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, even if it were true that adopting flipped classroom or MOOC content may result in the loss of research or teaching positions, from a utilitarian perspective, the urgent needs of many (students who have limited access to higher education due to cost issues) outweigh the needs of a (relatively) privileged few.</p>
<p>The rapidly escalating cost and inefficiencies of higher education requires a decisive change to current educational policies to reverse. These policy changes however will also necessitate a corresponding shift in emphasis for current state and community colleges to focus on services other than lecturing or grading which can be delegated or automated. In turn, this will force institutions to redefine their value proposition to students. While this may be an uncomfortable transition for current faculty and instructors, it is clear that significant changes will have to be made to accommodate the large number of students who are currently denied access to higher education due to these existing cost inefficiencies.</p>
