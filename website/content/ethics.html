<h3>The Ethics of MOOCs</h3>
<h4>Concerns about the &quot;for-profit&quot; nature of MOOC providers</h4>
<p>A source of criticism levelled at MOOCs (and their providers) is that unlike universities, colleges and their ilk, MOOC providers such as Udacity and Coursera are for-profit entities backed by venture capital and thus may be primarily concerned with business interests rather than the best interest of students [1]. This perceived &quot;privatization&quot; of higher education raises a variety of ethical concerns regarding the motives of MOOC providers and the potential impact the &quot;MOOC disruption&quot; would have on higher education [2].</p>
<p>While there are real and valid concerns about the ethical implications of online education, much of the rhetoric regarding the &quot;for-profit&quot; nature of MOOC providers centers around speculation and not concrete evidence. Aaron Bady, a PhD student at Berkeley warns: &quot;once the last vestiges of state supported higher education has been burned to the ground—and that they will have no choice but to queue up for whatever slop the market deigns to provide them.&quot; [3]</p>
<p>Much of these worries are driven primarily by a deontological view of the issue at hand which values intent over the effect of one's actions. It is assumed that public school systems, by virtue of the fact that they exist primarily for the purposes of education must necessarily be superior to commercial entities driven by a profit motive.</p>
<p>However, from a utilitarian (and pragmatic) point-of-view, the public education system has <strong>performed poorly</strong> in maintaining <strong>low-cost, high availability</strong> access to higher education (see: <a href="http://frankchn.github.io/cs181/website/index.html#state">State of Higher Ed</a>). If MOOC providers can provide a <strong>superior</strong> or <strong>more accessible alternative</strong> to a larger audience, they should not be condemned solely for the fact that they are a commercial enterprise, instead, we should judge the ethical merit of MOOCs (and their providers) based on the social good they do. This motivates our discussion on the perceived quality of MOOC instruction below.</p>
<h4>Concerns about the quality of MOOC instruction</h4>
<p>Concerns have also been raised regarding the quality of instruction offered in MOOCs. Primarily, concerns have been raised regarding whether supplanting on-campus instruction with online or blended learning style instruction will create a two-tier system. A system where students in state or community colleges will receive a sub-par education, while only students who can afford or quality to attend top-tier institutions will receive a full college education. [4]</p>
<p>Critics of MOOCs argue that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Methods used to scale MOOCs such as heavy use of peer grading and automated machine grading are inferior to traditional methods such as expert graders. [5]</li>
    <li>MOOCs provide a sub-par educational experience because MOOC providers do not understand the pedagogical aspect of education. [6]</li>
    <li>MOOCs are inferior to an on-campus education since colleges and universities provide resources other than education such as career services, counselling, residential education among other things.</li>
    <li>MOOCs lack local context and understanding of the specific needs of the target audience, instead it promulgates a one-size-fits-all style of education where courses from top-tier institutions such as Stanford or Harvard are exported and forced upon students who are very dissimilar to the students at such top-tier institutions. [7]</li>
</ol>
<p>Such concerns are especially relevant in the wake of Coursera's recent  announcement of partnerships with state university systems in 10 states, to use MOOC style instruction to "improve completion, quality, and access to higher education" for the nearly 1.3 million students in these state systems,  as well as Udacity's announcement that they will be offering a masters degree in Computer Science in partnership with Georgia Institute of Technology. [8, 9]</p>
<p>In response to such concerns, proponents of MOOCs argue that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Peer grading has been shown to both be similar in reliability to expert graders and also serve a pedagogical purpose. Studies have shown that peer grading in the classroom results in improved learning outcomes. [10] <br><br> While MOOCs are a relatively more recent phenomena and hence are not as well studied, initial forays into this area have shown that peer grading can be applied successfully to evaluate complex submissions in a MOOC setting [11]</li>
    <li>Automated essay grading is not novel and has been used for high-stakes standardized testing such as the SATs and the GREs by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) for sometime.[12]</li>
    <li>Providers of MOOCs do not advocate for the abolishment of on-campus education. Programs such as the Coursera-state system partnership are meant in part to benefit current on-campus students by lowering the cost of on-campus courses or allowing institutions to share educational resources. An analogy is to think of such MOOC resources as a new form of textbooks where the instructor is free to use and adapt course material for their own courses. <br><br>Currently, in the state of California alone, almost half a million students are on wait-list for oversubscribed courses, with only 14% able to graduate on time and 60% able to graduate within <strong>8 years</strong> [13, 14]. MOOC providers see their offerings as a means of easing this enrollment bottleneck, thereby giving on-campus students a better experience.</li>
    <li>Initial experiments in the area of integrating MOOC style instruction into a blended classroom setting have been promising. In a recent pilot experiment between San Jose State University and EdX, switching to a blended classroom course taught using MIT's Introduction to Electronics MOOC course resulted in a 30% improvement in passing rates [15]. Anecdotally, instructors in premier institutions such as Rice University have also reported success in implementing a flipped-classroom model in their own on-campus courses including using peer-evaluation and online lecture videos.</li>
    <li>The comparison between MOOC style instruction and on-campus instruction is unfair. Programs such as Udacity-Georgia Tech's masters program in Computer Science would provide an opportunity for 10,000 students to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech for under $7,000 [16]. These programs are intended to give non-traditional students who would otherwise be denied access to higher education degree earning opportunities. </li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, different students will have different needs and MOOC providers generally do not believe in a one-size-fits-all model. For example, Coursera, one of the largest MOOC providers today, provides several different services to students including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Free open access MOOCs for students who are primarily interested in access to educational materials.</li>
    <li>A verified track called Signature Track where keystroke biometrics and webcam verification is used to authenticate students, for students who are interested in a verified credential. [17]</li>
    <li>American Council on Education (ACE) accredited courses with webcam proctoring services for students who are interested in using courses for transfer credit contributing to a traditional degree program. [18]</li>
    <li>Flipped classroom/blended learning style teaching at partner universities or new state system partners for students who are currently enrolled in an on-campus degree program. [19]</li>
</ol>
<p>Ethical concerns over the quality of MOOC offerings should thus to be directed towards a specific target audience.</p>
<h4>Concerns about equitability of access</h4>
<p>Ethical concerns have also been raised regarding the equitability of access to educational resources. Observers note that within the current demographic of MOOC students, a large majority have possess a Bachelors degree or higher. [20]</p>
<p>While MOOCs were designed to be "open" in the sense of promoting overall accessibility of quality higher education, in reality, a majority of MOOC students already have prior exposure to college or university level education.</p>
<p>While the current educational profile of the student population on MOOCs does indeed skew towards a more highly educated population, much of this bias is probably due to the "early adopter" effect rather than any significant barriers posed to less educated students.</p>
<p>Factors which support the role of MOOCs in equalizing access to higher education are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Nearly half of students on the largest MOOC platform (Coursera) are from developing economies. [21]</li>
    <li>MOOCs provide low-cost alternative to cost-conscious students. Udacity offers a Computer Science masters degree for only $7,000, while Coursera offers their verified credential product to students in need for free under their financial aid program. [22, 23]</li>
    <li>Cumulative completions in certain MOOCs already far out-number the number of students who complete such courses in their originating institutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it still remains to be seen if MOOCs will live up to their promise of providing free and easy access to quality education for the masses, it would be premature to dismiss this as pure hype so early on in the development of MOOCs.</p>
