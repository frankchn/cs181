<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
    In the past year, the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has been one of the biggest
    stories in American Higher Education. Three behemoths &mdash; Coursera, edX and Udacity have
    emerged from the fray, each boasting millions of users.

    However, this rapid rise to fame and millions of students has also brought many questions from supporters and critics alike:
    <ul>
        <li>Why are two of the leading MOOC providers for-profit?</li>
        <li>Are MOOCs really that good for students?</li>
        <li>How much does MOOC really alleviate the problem of equity in access?</li>
        <li>Should state systems adopt blended classroom learning to lower costs?</li>
        <li>What should be done about faculty who are displaced by this MOOC revolution?</li>
    </ul>

    In this project, we seek to clarify and answer these questions.
