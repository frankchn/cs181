<h3>What's a MOOC?</h3>
<p>A massive open online course (MOOC) is a course aimed at large-scale audiences -- in the tens to hundreds of thousands -- delivered via the Internet. MOOCs typically do not charge tuition fees or offer academic credit. </p>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>The current revolution in MOOCs started with three classes offered by Stanford Computer Science professors in Fall 2011.</p>

<h4>Courses and Students</h4>
<p>The big three MOOC providers, Coursera, Udacity and edX offers a combined 461 courses from over 100 partner universities. The breadth of courses offered has expanded greatly from the original three Computer Science courses offered, with courses ranging from Modern and Contemporary American Poetry to Probabilistic Graphical Models. </p>
<p>In the largest MOOC provider, Coursera, over 3.5 million students have registered for accounts and courses have been subscribed to over ten million times by these students. Other MOOC providers report similar numbers, with edX and Udacity both reporting over 1 million students registered each.</p>
<h4>Credentialing</h4>
<p>There have been experiments to provide verifiable and accurate credentials for these online classes. edX and Udacity have both used Pearson testing centers to provide final exams and verifiable certificates while Coursera launched Signature Track, a system designed for online credentials verification using keystroke biometrics technology. These experiments are still the in very early stages and will evolve over time, responding to student and instructor demands.</p>
